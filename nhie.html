                                <strong>NEVER HAVE I WHAT?</strong>

Never Have I Ever played the game Never Have I Ever? We can fix that.

The original drinking game plays out like this - players get into a circle then the first player says a simple statement 
starting with "Never have I ever.." 

Anyone who at some point in their lives has done the action that the first player mentions must drink.

We play it without the alcohol, just keeping score, but you're welcome to drink or smoke along at home.


                                <strong>OK, LET'S PLAY A GAME</strong>

First up, you need to make sure Keevee is in the room. She's the NHIE. Sometimes she's not around.
An OP in the room needs to start the game using the command <strong>.nhie #</strong>, where # is the number of rounds to play.
i.e., <strong>.nhie 10</strong> to play a game with 10 questions before ending.

To join a game about to begin, use the <strong>.join</strong> command. 
You can remove yourself from a game by using <strong>.resign</strong>.

For each round, type either <strong>.have</strong> if you have done whatever Keevee says, or <strong>.never</strong> if you haven't.

Once all the rounds have been completed, Keevee will let you know which player scored the most haves, and which the have nots.

You can also use .players to announce the people playing (and list who hasn't yet answered).

                                <strong>COULD YOU JUST LIST ALL THE NHIE COMMANDS?</strong>
Yes.

.have = answer a question with "have done"
.never = answer a question with "never done"
.join = join a pending game
.resign = remove yourself from the game

.players = announce the players (and who hasn't yet answered)

The commands below will only work for OPs in the room :
 
.nhie # = start a game with # rounds (OPs only)
.start = start the first round  (OPs only)
.cancel = cancel a game (OPs only)
 
.boot [player] = remove a player from the game
.transfer [player] = let another player be the host (current host only)
 
.add [question here] = adds a question to the list (OPs only)


                                <strong>WHERE'S THIS KEEVEE BOT AT?</strong>
If Keevee isn't in the room, just ask Kettle or Candie{K} to get her up and running for you. If neither of those two are around,
you're just fresh outta luck. Sorry.


We'll hopefully have a scheduled night to play soon, so that you can make sure you're around to play with us!
