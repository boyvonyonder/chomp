                                <strong>THAT WAS JUST AN UNHELPFUL LIST</strong>

you are totally correct. here is a more helpful but far longer list.


<strong>"ident": "trailerparkmod",
"category": "locations",</strong>
"description": "Adds trailer parks to map generation, as well as regular and small trailers.",

+ everything works
+ probably need to make the reclaimed version spawn way less

<strong>"ident": "lightsabermod",
"category": "items",</strong>
"description": "Adds the beam sword, a powerful and difficult to make endgame weapon made from a crystalized portal shard.",

+ everything works
+ now quite an exhausting undertaking to create
+ currently working on melee mods
https://github.com/kettleswordfang/lightsabermod

<strong>"ident": "shinigamimod", [1]
"category": "class",</strong>
"description": "Adds the Shinigami / Grim Reaper Martial Art and Professions, as well as new weapons for her.",

+ everything works
+ relic scythes don't spawn anywhere yet
https://github.com/kettleswordfang/reapermod

<strong>"ident": "hacktheplanet",  
"category": "vintage cyberpunk gear",</strong>
"description": "Adds the Phrack Magazine to the game, and to the hacker profession loadout and to the new guerilla hacker, which has recipes for a bunch of stuff.",

+ everything works
+ a portable balance transfer machine, handhelp gps devices and the ability to create science, gas and military cards using a homemade magnetic strip encoder. Also the Zintendo Power Glove.

<strong>"ident": "potatomod", [2]
"category": "items",</strong>
"description": "Adds the companion potato, a very important tool for surviving after the collapse of civilisation.",

+ everything works
+ can be used with radio control modification
+ also now in the Crazy Cataclysm mod
https://github.com/kettleswordfang/potatomod

---

<strong>"ident": "gunslingermod", [3]
"category": "class",</strong>
"description": "Adds the Gunslinger of Eld class, only with a heap of items for her. Not quite finished yet.",

+ still in development
+ comes with .60 big bore revolver, upgradable twice
+ can easily dismantle ammo, but needs to hold on to her casings to remake hers
https://github.com/kettleswordfang/gunslingermod

---

<strong>"ident": "randomkettlemods", [4]
"category": "assorted_flavours",</strong>
"description": "Adds a bunch of random little things, most of them from mods that I didn't create.",
https://github.com/kettleswordfang/randommods

+ Returns the ability to sheath a knife in most boots*, including the gunslinger's.
+ combat lawnmower, jogiri, fine katana, iron ball and chain and the assassin blade, all translated and fixed*.
+ the target dummy from /gunslingermod. the recipe is in all the shooting magazines, just use it to place it then it's a mob that can't attack you pretty much, for training up ranged skills.
+ new profession that uses the monomolecular blade, because i like it. doesn't really balance that advantage out at all.
+ a satchel that's bigger on the inside. needs a portal around to create it. carries a lot of stuff - made after @Djur on discord suggested it.


                                <strong>WHAT ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS, THEN?</strong>
[1] <em>shinigamimod</em> is totally inspired the japanese grim reaper mod - i started fixing it, then just rewrote the whole thing and added a whole bunch of weapons. the new scythes all have sprites in @ChestHole's main tilesets. a few of the scythes come from Soul Calibur.

[2] <em>potatomod</em> is in Crazy Cataclysm now! \o/

[3] <em>gunslingermod</em> is totally still in progress. it's playable, i guess. but not finished at all. i'll get on that.

[4] boot sheaths and the weapons in randomkettlemods are from the japanese wiki, i just didn't like the rest of what they included : https://www57.atwiki.jp/cataclyj/pages/235.html
