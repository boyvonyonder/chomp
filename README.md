<strong>JUST GIMME THE BASICS</strong>

CHOMP does profiles. You know you want one.

To create a new profile, type <strong>!setup</strong> in the main channel (#thetoybox).

CHOMP will PM you with a few questions to answer about yourself -
role, gender identity, orientation, kinks, limits and description.

You can update a profile by typing <strong>!edit</strong> in the channel.
If you really want to, you can also <strong>!delete</strong> your profile completely.

Once you have a profile of your own, you can view another profile in the channel.
To do this, use <strong>!view username</strong>. For instance, !view CHOMP to view CHOMP's profile.
