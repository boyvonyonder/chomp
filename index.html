                                <strong>JUST GIMME THE BASICS</strong>

CHOMP does profiles. You know you want one.

To create a new profile, type <strong>!setup</strong> in the main channel (#thetoybox).

CHOMP will PM you with a few questions to answer about yourself -
role, gender identity, orientation, kinks, limits and description.

You can update a profile by typing <strong>!edit</strong> in the channel.
If you really want to, you can also <strong>!delete</strong> your profile completely.

Once you have a profile of your own, you can view another profile in the channel.
To do this, use <strong>!view username</strong>. For instance, <strong>!view CHOMP</strong> to view CHOMP's profile.


                                <strong>TELL ME ABOUT THESE "THINGS" CHOMP CAN DO</strong>

Need to see the rules? Type <strong>!rules</strong> to get them in a PM. Using <strong>!info</strong> will also give you this page.

The funnest things CHOMP can do are <em>Spin the Bottle</em> and <em>Hotseat</em>.

    Use <strong>!spin</strong> to play a game of spin the bottle.
    It works just like it did back in those high school parties I was never invited to.
    If you're confused, just give it a !spin and you'll see.
    Once you have spun, it's polite to let the person it landed on !spin next[1].

    Use <strong>!hotseat</strong> to have CHOMP ask you a possible naughty question.
    Some of these are a little rude - but that's what you're here for, right? If not,
    you may have accidentally joined the wrong server.
    
    CHOMP can tell your fortune! He's very wise. Use <strong>!tarot</strong> (for just
    one card), or <strong>!tarot 3</strong> (for multiple cards, up to 7)

    CHOMP can also run a game of Texas Hold 'Em for the room, if you want, using <strong>!holdem</strong>.
    he'll explain how to play to everyone - when you're in game just say what you want to, he's listening to the players
    you can use !stop to end a game in progress.
    This game isn't ON by default, as it takes up the channel - speak to Kettle if you would like to play.

If you see Keevee logged in, the room also plays Never Have I Ever[3].

I'll do my best to keep this updated for you, so you're in the know.

  [1] If you really don't want the bottle to ever land on you, just ask Kettle to add you to CHOMP's no-spin-list.

  [2] Don't know what a Nudibranch is? For shame! Just ask Pai/Peridot to show you the best ones, or try that google thing.

  [3] But Keevee isn't around! Where is that darn bot? Stop crying and ask Kettle to get her up and running for you.

  [4] Banishes who with the what now? You should check out <a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/">Steven Universe</a>. It's great.

  [5] CHOMP is also Kettle's stuffed dinosaur. <a href="chompselfie.jpg">He's super cute</a>, huh? We love him a lot.
